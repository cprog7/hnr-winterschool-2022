## Preparing for the Winter School  

For those not familiar with Python, here are some instructions for you to prepare for the Winter School:

 - We highly recommend that you install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) (or Miniconda), according to your operating system.  
Anaconda will automatically install Python, Jupyter Notebook, and all Python packages we will use during the workshop. Anaconda is a stress-free way of starting with Python.  
 - This repository has a Python tutorial using Jupyter Notebook:  
     1- Introduction_Jupyter_Python.ipynb  
     You have to open the file already using Jupyter Notebook. If you do not know how to do it, check this [documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/ae-notebooks/user-guide/basic-tasks/apps/jupyter/index.html).
